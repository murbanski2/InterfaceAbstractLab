    //is that we ignore any special public functions that are provided as part
    //of the child class.  AdvancedJavaCourse has a getCapitalizedCourseName() 
    //function that could be nice, but it doesn't exist anywhere else.  If we
    //needed it for this Startup method, we could chose to put it there.
